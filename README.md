# ABOUT:

- Silly little script to get the roster for the up-coming week's VS experiments.
- Good practice in regex, but not really that practical...

- It works but is slow and the whole approach feels wrong, very hacked together... will return to this another time, refreshed,
  should use awk and ditch the while loop. Properly figure out the regex so don't need grep to catch the cancelled session or the
  blank lines.... another time

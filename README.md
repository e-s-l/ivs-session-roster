# ABOUT:

- Silly little script to get the roster for the up-coming week's IVS experiments.

- Good practice in regex, but not really that practical...

- It works but is slow and the whole approach feels wrong, very hacked together... will return to this another time, refreshed...
  
- Should use awk and ditch the while loop. 

- Properly figure out the regex so don't need grep to catch the cancelled session or the
  blank lines.... another time

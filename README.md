# ABOUT:

- Silly little script to get the roster for the up-coming week's VS experiments.
- Good practice in regex, but not really that practical...

- It works but is slow and the whole approach feels wrong... will return to this another time, refreshed. 

## NOTE:

- Currently doesn't distinguish between experiments in which the station has been cancelled. Need to fix this.
